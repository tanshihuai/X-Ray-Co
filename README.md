## Summary
Our model will predict the probability of someone being at risk of having COVID-19, Pneunomia or is healthy given an X-Ray image. This prediction helps doctors get a better picture and improve on their decision making process on whether a patient has contracted COVID-19 or not.

***Doctors***
<br>
Doctors are able to see how likely a patient has COVID-19 from their symptoms. They can also register a patient for an X-Ray, see how likely they are to be COVID-positive from the X-Ray, diagnose the patient and prescribe them medicine.
